# Daily Planner App

Daily Planner App is a simple web application that allows you to save events for each hour of the day. It uses [Day.js](^1^) to work with date and time, and [jQuery](^2^) to manipulate the DOM and handle user interactions. It also uses [Bootstrap](^3^) for styling and [Font Awesome](^4^) for icons.

## User Story
